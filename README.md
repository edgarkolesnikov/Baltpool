Url checker Homework

About the project.

Work contains simple url checker with response of that url's status code, counts of redirects and keywords count search on certain page.
Few tests were included to test if page, form and links works.

This little project took me in total of around 12 hours to make it work including with all documentation readings, project installation and setup
and browsing.
